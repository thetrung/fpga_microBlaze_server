### MicroBlaze Server Sample Project on Arty-A7
This project was created & refined in Vivado 2023.2, after dilligent outdated-tutorial & require Vitis 2022.2 to build for Arty-A7, due to old lwip211 compatibility.

#### NOTE :
**lwip211** : For Arty-A7, and all soft-core processor FPGA, along FreeRTOS, as from 213 version, there is no longer support for them but Zynq & above.
